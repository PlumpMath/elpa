#+TITLE: Test ELPA repository

The idea is to install packages like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'package)

(add-to-list 
 'package-archives 
 '("kitchingroup" . "http://github.com/jkitchin/elpa/") t)

(unless package-archive-contents    ;; Refresh the packages descriptions
  (package-refresh-contents))

(setq package-load-list '(all))     ;; List of packages to load

(unless (package-installed-p '15-110)  ;; Make sure the Org package is
  (package-install '15-110))           ;; installed, install it if not

(package-initialize)                ;; Initialize & Install Package
#+END_SRC
